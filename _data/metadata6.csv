The Leni-Kiko rally was overflowing with camaraderie, bayanihan, and goodwill. Everybody was looking out for each other and spoke to each other with such kindness that you just felt so inspired by the example that former vice president Robredo has imbibed to us. It was not only raining pink that day, but also the call for good and honest governance.
